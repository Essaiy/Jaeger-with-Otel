**How to use OTel with Jaeger**

Step 1: Choose a Programming Language

OpenTelemetry provides auto-instrumentation for various languages, including Java, Python, Go, .NET, and more. Ensure that both OpenTelemetry and Jaeger are available for your chosen language. For the purpose of this guide, we assume you're using Python.

Step 2: Install Required Tools & Libraries

Install Jaeger through Docker:

```docker run -d --name jaeger \
  -e COLLECTOR_ZIPKIN_HTTP_PORT=9411 \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5778:5778 \
  -p 16686:16686 \
  -p 14268:14268 \
  -p 14250:14250 \
  -p 9411:9411 \
  jaegertracing/all-in-one:latest
```

Install the necessary OpenTelemetry and Jaeger libraries for your programming language. The specific libraries required may vary depending on the language. Here is an example snippet for Python to install the libraries in Dockerfile:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8

RUN pip install opentelemetry-api opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-instrumentation-http requests jaeger-client
```

Step 3: Configure the OTel Exporter
Set up the OTel exporter to send traces to your Jaeger backend. Provide the appropriate configuration options, such as the Jaeger endpoint URL and any authentication credentials needed. This configuration can be done through environment variables or a configuration file.

```python
import os
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.exporter.jaeger.thrift import JaegerExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.resources import Resource

jaeger_host = os.getenv("JAEGER_HOST", "localhost")
jaeger_port = os.getenv("JAEGER_PORT", "6831")

trace.set_tracer_provider(
    trace.TracerProvider(
        resource=Resource.create({"service.name": "your-application-name"})
    )
)

jaeger_exporter = JaegerExporter(agent_host_name=jaeger_host, agent_port=jaeger_port)

trace.get_tracer_provider().add_span_processor(
    trace.BatchSpanProcessor(jaeger_exporter)
)
```

Step 4: Enable Auto-Instrumentation
Activate the OpenTelemetry auto-instrumentation module. Depending on the programming language, this may involve adding an initialization snippet or modifying your application's configuration. Here's an example for a Flask web application:

```python
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

# Instrument the Flask application
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
```

Step 5: Verify Tracing
Test your application to ensure that traces are being captured and exported to Jaeger. Generate some test requests that exercise different parts of your application. Use the Jaeger UI to verify that the traces are arriving at the backend and can be visualized.

```bash
docker run -e JAEGER_HOST=your-jaeger-host -e JAEGER_PORT=your-jaeger-port your-docker-image
```

Step 6: Explore and Analyze Traces
Once traces are successfully captured and sent to Jaeger, use Jaeger's rich visualization UI to analyze them and gain insights into application performance. The Jaeger backend should be available at 

`http://your-jaeger-host:your-jaeger-port`.

Step 7: Fine-Tune Configuration
Adjust auto-instrumentation configuration options to meet your specific requirements. This may include tweaking sampling strategies, adding custom attributes to traces or excluding certain parts of your codebase from instrumentation.

Step 8: Monitor and Optimize
Continuously monitor your application's traces to identify bottlenecks or areas for optimization. 

**OpenTelemetry to Jaeger Transformation**
Jaeger accepts tracing information formats such as OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP), Thrift Batch and Protobuf Batch. A range of attributes, including trace, parent and span IDs, start and end times, attributes, events, links and status can be mapped from OpenTelemetry to Jaeger formats to enable Jaeger understand and process the data for visualization. Convert OpenTelemetry spans into Jaeger formats by following the steps outlined below. 

Step 1: Ingesting Spans from Jaeger Using OpenTelemetry
To ingest spans from Jaeger, set up the OpenTelemetry Collector with a Jaeger receiver. The Jaeger receiver acts as a bridge between Jaeger and OpenTelemetry. Here's an example configuration file for the OpenTelemetry Collector with Jaeger receiver.

```yaml
receivers:
  jaeger:
    protocols:
      grpc:
      thrift_http:

exporters:
  logging:

processors:
  batch:

service:
  pipelines:
    traces:
      receivers: [jaeger]
      processors: [batch]
      exporters: [logging]
```

Step 2: OpenTelemetry Collector
Set up and run the OpenTelemetry Collector using the configuration file from the previous step. Here's an example of how to run the OpenTelemetry Collector.

```bash
docker run --rm -v /path/to/config.yaml:/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib:latest --config=/etc/otel-collector-config.yaml
```

Make sure to replace `/path/to/config.yaml` with the path to your actual configuration file.


Step 3: Jaeger Receiver
With the OpenTelemetry Collector running, you can now configure Jaeger Agent and HotRod to send spans to it. Here's an example of configuring the Jaeger Agent.

```bash
docker run --rm -p 6831:6831/udp -p 6832:6832/udp jaegertracing/jaeger-agent:latest --reporter.grpc.host-port=<otel_collector_host>:14250
```

Replace `<otel_collector_host>` with the hostname or IP address of the machine running the OpenTelemetry Collector.

Step 4: Jaeger Agent and HotRod
To simulate sending spans to Jaeger, you can use the Jaeger Agent and HotRod.

Start the Jaeger Agent Container:
```bash
docker run --name jaeger-agent \
  -p 5778:5778/udp \
  -p 6831:6831/udp \
  -p 6832:6832/udp \
  -p 5775:5775/udp \
  jaegertracing/jaeger-agent:latest
```

Start the HotRod:
```bash
docker run --name hotrod \
  -e JAEGER_AGENT_HOST=your_jaeger_agent_host \
  -e JAEGER_AGENT_PORT=6831 \
  -p 8080-8083:8080-8083 \
  jaegertracing/example-hotrod:latest all
```

Replace `your_jaeger_agent_host` with the address of the Jaeger Agent container.

Step 5: Examples
Now that everything is set up, you can instrument your applications with OpenTelemetry and start generating and exporting traces. Here's an example of using OpenTelemetry in Python:

```python
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.trace import SpanKind

# Create a tracer
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)

# Create a span
with tracer.start_as_current_span("example_span", kind=SpanKind.SERVER) as span:
    # Add custom attributes or events if needed
    span.set_attribute("example_attribute", "value")
    span.add_event("example_event")

    # Perform your application logic

    # End the span
    span.end()
```

Once the spans are generated, the OpenTelemetry Collector configured with the Jaeger receiver will pick them up and forward them to downstream exporters. You should now see spans flowing from the Hot Rod to the Jaeger Agent, and from there to the OpenTelemetry Collector. Afterwards, the OpenTelemetry Collector will transform and send the spans to Jaeger. You can then use Jaeger's user interface accessible at http://localhost:16686 to visualize and analyze the collected spans.
